Howto
-----

Load the corresponding diagram file and select the diagram elements 
to create your own UML diagram. Those elements are grouped and can 
be stretched a bit. Texts can be replaced through a double-click on 
these. You may have to put elements into the background or foreground 
to get a correct presentation.

If necessary ungroup single diagram elements to influence the 
presentation of single objects inside the element.
